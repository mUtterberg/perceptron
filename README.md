# perceptron

The algorithm in [feedforward.m](https://github.com/mUtterberg/perceptron/blob/master/feedforward.m) is a simple feedforward neural net with one logistic hidden layer and a linear output layer. It takes in:

* W1 (an nxm matrix representing the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer),

* W2 (an m-dimensional vector representing weights between the hidden layer and the output layer), &

* X (a kxn matrix representing the data points)

and returns:

* Predicted value
